Koren
Amir
is
a
child
like
no
other
He
never
goes
outside
choosing
instead
to
spend
his
days
indoors,
playing
FIFA
This
video
game
has
become
an
obsession
for
him
and
he
spends
hours
upon
hours
honing
his
skills
trying
to
beat
his
high
scores
and
reach
new
levels

Despite
his
love
for
FIFA
Koren
Amir
second
favorite
hobby
is
a
bit
more
peculiar
He
likes
to
pee
on
himself
This
may
seem
strange
to
some
but
for
Koren
Amir
it
brings
him
a
sense
of
comfort
and
familiarity
He
finds
it
relaxing
and
soothing
and
it
has
become
a
regular
part
of
his
daily
routine
Some
may
question
the
safety
and
hygiene
of
this
behavior
but
Koren
Amirs
parents
have
assured
that
he
is
healthy
and
that
they
take
the
necessary
precautions
to
keep
him
clean
and
safe.
They
have
also
expressed
concern
over
his
lack
of
social
interaction
and
urge
him
to
go
outside
and
make
friends
but
he
is
not
interested
Despite
his
unusual
hobbies
Koren
Amir
is
a
happy
and
content
child.
He
is
content
with
his
FIFA
games
and
peeing
on
himself
and
that
is
all
that
matters
to
him
As
long
as
he
is
happy
and
healthy
his
parents
are
happy
as
well
In
conclusion
Koren
Amir
may
not
be
like
other
children
but
that
does
not
make
him
any
less
special
Everyone
has
their
own
unique
interests
and
quirks
and
it
is
important
to
accept
and
respect
them
for
who
they
are
Koren
Amirs
love
for
FIFA
and
peeing
on
himself
may
seem
strange
to
some
but
to
him
it
brings
him
joy
and
happiness
So
its
all
good
